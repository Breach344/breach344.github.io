  <p id="description">
    I'm mainly a front end web developer with a passion for all things coding.
    I've made worked on the front and back end of of websites, made helpful web
    tools, and worked on video games. I have the most fun when I'm learning
    something new and creating solutions. I'm experienced in dynamic web pages
    with my primary focus on fast loading times, responsive design, and
    intuitive UI for the ultimate user experience. If you want to see more of my

    <h2>Node.js Login Sales Site</h2>
    <p>
      Example of a potential sales website. Uses the Passport.js middleware with
      cookies to register, login, and if you're logged in to enable you to add
      items to your cart which will automatically update your total. The focus
      when building this project was on the main webpages layout and to to
      experiment with this middleware.

    <h2>PHP Database CMS</h2>
    <p>
      A content management system to allow the owner of a website to do a
      variety of things from posting news, blog posts, updating an event
      calendar, or can be restructured into a messenger application. It does
      this by adding, deleting, and changing things in a database so when you
      pull data it shows whatever the website owner changed it to. The login is
      stored within the session and will give you access to the admin pages only
      if you are logged in as a real user from the database. The input info is
      sanitized and passwords are also encrypted before being saved in the
      database for security purposes.

    <h2>Pokemon Red/Blue Dex</h2>
    <p>
      A Pokedex is a tool used to search for a Pokemon and tell you information
      about it. It is designed to look similar to the ones in the show and I'm
      pretty proud of how it came out appearance wise. These days I would save
      the Pokemon's info in a database and make it make it responsive for
      whatever device someone is looking at it on but for this the Pokemon info
      is saved as a Javascript object and when a Pokemon is selected it changes
      the text info to the corresponding information. For further improvements I
      would also make one function for all data changes to cut down on the code.
      I chose not to use some preexisting API's because I wanted to use the
      older game designs and I noticed errors on the API's I was looking at.

    <h2>Text/Image Translator</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes when you need a solution it doesnt have to be complicated and
      time consuming. By using Google Translate and the Google Vision API
      together you can take a picture of writing and translate it to another
      language. I built this pretty quickly because it was a real world problem
      that needed solving for me personally and I use it all the time. If you
      look on the app store there are a number of apps that do this that
      typically require you to spend money to use.

    <h2>FGO Duel(Video Game)</h2>
    <p>
      If you don't know the rules they're on the
      <a href="https://duel.fate-go.us/how_to_play/">official site</a>. It's
      still a work in progress but I wanted to show off what I'm working on.
      When you make an action it checks many variables before deciding what to
      do. Your pieces on the board are assigned individual classes that get
      removed and added from the tiles when you move in order to keep track of
      their locations. The turn phases are done with a number counter that
      changes based on your actions. Only certain actions are allowed for each
      phase(only when the turn counter variable is at certain values). Each card
      has an individual id to identify its type, power, and game piece. If all
      cards used in battle have a type in common they create a chain with
      varying abilities that could last several turns which I did by using
      variables that tick down counters when turns end. When a unit attempts to
      land on a space with an enemy class on it then it will start the battle
      function where it checks for card power, card chains, and the counter
      variables to see who wins. All the functionality is worked out and tested.
      There is just data entry, optimizing/organizing the code, and styling to
      finish.
