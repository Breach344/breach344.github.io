  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <p id="description">
    A full stack software engineer passionate for all things tech. I've
    made the front and back ends of sites, created helpful web tools, customized 
    business CRMs with Zoho, and worked on video games. I have the most fun learning 
    something new and creating solutions. I'm experienced in dynamic web design with 
    a primary focus on fast loading times, responsive design, and intuitive UI for an 
    easy user experience. I don't update this site often so if you want to see my current 
    work, my certifications, or have questions just

    <h2>Node.js Login Sales Site</h2>
    <p>
      Example of a potential sales website. Uses the Passport.js middleware with
      cookies to register, login, and if you're logged in to enable you to add
      items to your cart which will automatically update your total. The focus
      when building this project was on the main webpages layout and to
      experiment with this middleware.

    <h2>PHP Database CMS</h2>
    <p>
      A content management system to allow the owner of a website to do a
      variety of things from posting news, blog posts, updating an event
      calendar, or can be restructured into a messenger application. It does
      this by adding, deleting, and changing things in a database so when you
      pull data it shows whatever the website owner changed it to. The login is
      stored within the session and will give you access to the admin pages only
      if you are logged in as a real user from the database. The input info is
      sanitized and passwords are also encrypted before being saved in the
      database for security purposes.

    <h2>Pokemon Red/Blue Dex</h2>
    <p>
      A Pokedex is a tool used to search for a Pokemon and tell you information
      about it. It is designed to look similar to the ones in the show and I'm
      pretty proud of how it came out appearance wise. These days I would save
      the Pokemon's info in a database and make it make it responsive for
      whatever device someone is looking at it on but for this the Pokemon info
      is saved as a Javascript object and when a Pokemon is selected it changes
      the text info to the corresponding information. For further improvements I
      would also make one function for all data changes to cut down on the code.
      I chose not to use some preexisting API's because I wanted to use the
      older game designs and I noticed errors on the API's I was looking at.

    <h2>Text/Image Translator</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes when you need a solution it doesnt have to be complicated and
      time consuming. By using Google Translate and the Google Vision API
      together you can take a picture of writing and translate it to another
      language. I built this pretty quickly because it was a real world problem
      that needed solving for me personally and I use it all the time. If you
      look on the app store there are a number of apps that do this that
      typically require you to spend money to use.

    <h2>FGO Duel(Video Game)</h2>
    <p>
      The rules are on the
      <a href="https://duel.fate-go.us/how_to_play/">official site</a>. It's
      still a work in progress but I wanted to show this off. Your pieces on the 
      board are assigned individual classes that get removed and added from the tiles 
      when you move in order to keep track of their locations. Turn phases are done 
      with a number counter. Only certain actions are allowed for each phase(only when 
      the turn counter variable is at certain values). Each card has an individual id 
      to identify its type, power, and game piece. If all cards used in battle have a 
      type in common they create a chain with varying abilities that could last several 
      turns which I did by using variables that tick down counters when turns end. When 
      a unit attempts to land on a space with an enemy class on it then it will start the 
      battle function where it checks for card power, card chains, and the counter
      variables to see who wins. All functionality is tested. Only data entry, optimizing, 
      and styling remains.

    <h2>Neural Drive</h2>
    <p>
      The canvas element is controlled with Javascript functions in real time to create 
      a nearly impossible game for a human to complete. Next I created a self learning AI
      to solve it in order to showcase an example of how an AI can doing what humans can't when 
      used properly. You can select "Game" to try playing, "Network" to activate the neural network 
      which you can watch learn to play until it wins, or "Best Brain" to see a brain that's already 
      beaten the game. The AI sees through invisible lines in front of it that return a value based 
      on how early they're interrupted by an object. It learns through a form of reinforcement learning 
      where the car that goes the farthest gets the highest score and it's brain continues to the next 
      game. The AI's brain is a bunch of values for where and if it should turn depending on the values 
      it sees determining surrounding object distances. Each run it tries changing each variable that 
      decides if and where it should turn by a certain percentage and runs a number of simulations to 
      see if any result in a new high score.
